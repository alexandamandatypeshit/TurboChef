🍫 Fudgy Cocoa Brownies with Espresso Bloom
Ingredients (8x8 pan) 

115g butter (½ cup)

220g sugar total: 155g white + 65g brown

2 large eggs

1 tsp vanilla

75g cocoa powder (¾ cup)

65g flour (½ cup)

½ tsp salt

½ tsp espresso powder (very fine)

Optional: 1 tbsp oil for extra fudginess

Optional: 1–2 tbsp hot water or hot coffee for blooming

Method
1️⃣ Preheat

325°F (165°C)

Line or grease 8x8 Pyrex.

2️⃣ Bloom Cocoa + Espresso

Melt butter gently.

Stir in cocoa powder + espresso powder.

Optional: add 1–2 tbsp hot water or hot coffee.

Mix until smooth, glossy, no lumps.

3️⃣ Add Sugar

Stir in both sugars until fully combined (~1–2 min).

4️⃣ Add Eggs + Vanilla

Whisk in eggs one at a time.

Add vanilla.

Whisk 1–2 minutes until glossy.

5️⃣ Add Dry Ingredients

Fold in flour + salt gently until just combined.

Stop as soon as no flour streaks remain.

Batter will be thick — perfect for gooey brownies.

6️⃣ Bake

Spread evenly in pan.

Bake 22–28 min:

Edges set

Center slightly soft/jiggly

Toothpick = moist crumbs, not wet batter

Tip for gooey: pull slightly early — it will continue to set in hot glass dish.

7️⃣ Cool

Cool 30–45 minutes in pan before cutting.

Optional: sprinkle flaky salt for sweet-salty contrast.

✅ Result: glossy crackly top, deep chocolate flavor, soft and gooey center enhanced by espresso bloom.
