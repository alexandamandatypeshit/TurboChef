🍥 Brioche Cinnamon Rolls (8x8 pan, 6 big rolls)
Dough

250g flour

40g sugar

1 tsp salt

2¼ tsp active dry yeast (1 packet / 7g)

120g warm milk (105–110°F)

1 egg

75g very soft butter (this is the brioche move)

75g = 30% butter.
Now we’re in real brioche territory.

1️⃣ Bloom Yeast

Warm milk + 1 tsp sugar + yeast
Let foam 5–10 min.

2️⃣ Mix

Combine:

Flour

Remaining sugar

Salt

Add:

Yeast mixture

Egg

Mix until shaggy.

Knead 5–6 minutes first.

3️⃣ Add Butter Slowly

Add butter in 3–4 additions while kneading.

At first it will look broken and greasy.
Keep kneading. It will come together.

Total kneading time: ~10–12 minutes.

You want:

Smooth

Elastic

Slightly tacky

Soft but not sticky

4️⃣ First Rise

1.5–2 hours
Until doubled.

Brioche may take slightly longer because of fat.

5️⃣ Filling (Go Rich)

60g very soft butter

80g brown sugar

1½ tbsp cinnamon

Pinch salt

Spread evenly.

Roll tight.

Cut into 6.

Place in buttered 8x8 pan.

6️⃣ Second Rise

45–75 minutes.

Important:
Brioche needs a good second rise.

They should look:

Puffy

Soft

Almost marshmallow-like

If they look dense → wait.

7️⃣ Gooey Trick (Optional but Elite)

Pour 3 tbsp warm cream over rolls before baking.

This melts into the bottoms and makes that gooey center magic.

8️⃣ Bake

350°F
20–25 minutes

Because of higher butter, they brown faster.
Pull when golden but soft in center.

9️⃣ Cream Cheese Glaze (Mandatory Here)

100g cream cheese

40–50g powdered sugar

Splash milk

Pinch salt

Spread while warm.

What to Expect

Compared to your earlier rolls:

Softer crumb

More pull-apart

Rich mouthfeel

More forgiving if slightly underbaked

Slightly longer rise
