  - Let dough rise until airy and roughly 60–75% increased in volume (not fully doubled).
  - Pre-shape into a loose round. Rest 20 minutes.
  - Shape tightly into a boule, building surface tension.
  - Proof 45–75 minutes at room temp (poke test: slow spring back).
  - Preheat oven to 475°F (245°C) with an empty metal pan on the lower rack.
  - Transfer dough to parchment, score 1–2 decisive cuts.
  - Pour hot water into the preheated lower pan to create steam and immediately load the bread.
  - Bake 10 minutes at 475°F (245°C) with steam.
  - Remove steam pan, reduce oven to 450°F (230°C), and bake 20 minutes more until deep golden brown.

  - Cool at least 1 hour before slicing.
