  - Pastry cream: Make real pastry cream and let cool.
  - Raisins: Soak golden raisins in rum or hot water until plump.
  - Shape: Roll out dough, spread with pastry cream, sprinkle with raisins. Roll up and slice into spirals or shape as loaf.
  - Proof: Let rise until puffy.

  - Finish: Brush with simple syrup (see Nappage léger) while hot for shine.

  - For best results, proof slowly in a cool place.
  - Use a baking stone for a crisp bottom.
  - Classic French bakery version uses preferment or levain and bakes in a deck oven.
